# Thesis

## Cloud-bases study system's backend project - Django/Django DRF

Notes:
 * Modules: `requirements.txt`
 * Some essential datas are in git ignored `.env` files. 
 * This web application in a production environment would run in the AWS cloud and would be stored in a private AWS CodeCommit repository. Some of the functions without AWS's private environment will not work. This public repository is just for demonstration purposes.
